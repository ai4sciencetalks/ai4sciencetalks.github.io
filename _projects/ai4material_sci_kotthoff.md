**Topic**:  **AI for Materials Science**


<hr>

**Abstract:**  

AI and machine learning have advanced the state of the art in many application domains. We present an application to materials science; in particular, we use surrogate models with Bayesian optimization for automated parameter tuning to optimize the fabrication of laser-induced graphene. This process allows to create thin conductive lines in thin layers of insulating material, enabling the development of next-generation nano-circuits. We are able to achieve improvements of up to a factor of two compared to existing approaches in the literature and to what human experts are able to achieve. Our implementation is based on the open-source mlr and mlrMBO frameworks and can be applied in many other contexts, some of which we briefly outline at the end of the talk.
